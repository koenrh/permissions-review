# permissions.review

[permissions.review](https://www.permissions.review/) is a little guide and checklist
that helps you review permissions granted to third-party applications and services
that have access your accounts. Reviewing these permissions, and revoking permissions
of applications and services you don't recognise or don't use, on a regular basis,
improves the security of your accounts.

Inspired by incidents such as the [compromise of The Counter](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/15/twitter-counter-hacked/).
